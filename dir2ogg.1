.TH DIR2OGG 1 "19 JULY 06"
.SH NAME
dir2ogg \- Convert MP3, WAV, and M4A files to OGG format
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdir2ogg\fP [ options ] ( \fIfilename\fP [\fIfilename2\fP] || \fIdirectory\fP [\fIdirectory2\fP] )
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdir2ogg\fP converts MP3, M4A, WMA and WAV files to the open\-source OGG format. \fIdir2ogg\fP is a python script that simply binds together mpg123, faad, and oggenc making it easier for the user to convert his/her music files. OGGs are about 15 to 20 percent smaller than MP3 files, with the same relative audio quality. \fIdir2ogg\fP can be called with the \fI\-d\fP flag at the command line to convert any number of directories at once, or given MP3, M4A, WMA,
and/or WAV filenames as arguments, \fIdir2ogg\fP will convert only those files. If converting WAV, M4A or WMA files with \fI\-d\fP you must add
the \fI\-w\fP, \fI\-m\fP or \fI\-f\fP command line flags respectively. These flags are not neccesary unless using \fI\-d\fP.
Note that converting M4A files requires you to have faad installed, and converting WMA files requires mplayer.

Keep in mind that converting from MP3 or M4A to OGG is a conversion between two lossy formats. This is fine if you just want to free up some disk space, but if you're a hard\-core audiophile you may be disappointed. I really can't notice a difference in quality with 'naked' ears myself.

.SS Options
.TP
\fB\-h or \-\-help\fP
print quick usage details to the screen.
.TP

.TP
\fB\-r or \-\-recursive\fP
like \fI\-d\fP but descends recursively into directories.
.TP
\fB\-p or \-\-preserve-wav\fP
preserve all WAV files. By default they are deleted.
.TP
\fB\-m or \-\-convert-m4a\fP
convert M4A files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP. Requires faad.
.TP
\fB\-f or \-\-convert-wma\fP
convert M4A files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP. Requires mplayer.
.TP

convert WAV files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP.
.TP
\fB\-n or \-\-no-mp3\fP
ignore MP3 files when converting a directory. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP.
.TP
\fB\-qN or \-\-quality=N\fP
OGG quality. N is a number between \-1 and 10. Default is 3. Decimals are OK (ie: 3.7)

.TP
\fB\-s or \-\-shell-protect\fP

.TP
\fB\-v or \-\-verbose\fP
increase \fIdir2ogg\fP's verbosity.

.SH BUGS
The special characters '"', '*', '!', and ';' will be removed from filenames.
The special character '&' will be converted to 'and'. These characters are known
to break the script when fed to bash. If you don't like the idea of this script
changing your filenames that is fair enough, but I submit these characters have
no business being in filenames anyway. If you want to write a patch that will
escape them rather than change the filename I'll be happy to include it, I am just
lazy and can't be bothered too do this myself :)
